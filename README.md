## Introduction

This project is a challenge made at the IFMG SabarÃ¡ campus, Bachelor of Information Systems course, where it is necessary to develop several programming olympics questions. [Joint](https://github.com/RodrigoCardoso-1007) development.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` (VSCode) or `.idea` (JetBrains) folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
